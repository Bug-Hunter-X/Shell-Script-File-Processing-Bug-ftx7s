# Shell Script File Processing Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in shell scripts related to file processing loops. The script `bug.sh` contains a subtle error in how it reads and processes lines from a file.  The provided solution, `bugSolution.sh`, corrects this issue.

## Bug Description

The `bug.sh` script uses a `while` loop with `read` to process lines from a file.  This is a common approach. However, under certain conditions (like an empty file or specific line endings), it can fail to process the last line correctly or behave unexpectedly.  This is often caused by how the loop's termination condition is handled.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.sh` script addresses the issue by implementing a more robust approach to file reading.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Create a file named `my_file.txt` with some text (at least two lines).
2. Run `bug.sh`. Observe the output.  The last line may be missed.
3. Now, modify `my_file.txt` to only have a single line or be empty. Re-run `bug.sh` to see alternative failure modes.

## How to use the solution

1. Run `bugSolution.sh`. The script will correctly process all lines in `my_file.txt`, even if it's empty or has only a single line.
